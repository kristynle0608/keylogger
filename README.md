## Title of Project
Keylogger

## Description
**Keylogger** is used to demostrate the idea of how a keylogger would work. The webpage contains general information about what a keylogger is and how to protect yourself against them. The main part of this webpage is the demonstration part, which will help the user to understand more about the keylogger. 

**DISCLAIMER**: The demonstration is not a real keylogger. I'm not smart nor talented enough to create one. Feel free to use it.
