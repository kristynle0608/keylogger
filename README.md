## Title of Project
Keylogger

## Description
**Keylogger** is used to demostrate the idea of how a keylogger would work. The webpage contains general information about what a keylogger is and how to protect yourself against them. The main part of this webpage is the demonstration part, which will help the user to understand more about the keylogger. 

**DISCLAIMER**: The demonstration is not a real keylogger. I'm not smart nor talented enough to create one. Feel free to use it.

### Inspiration for this Project
This project is inspired by *Codecademy*'s [Introduction to Cybersecurity](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-cybersecurity "Introduction to Cybersecurity | Codecademy") course. The *Cyber Threats* section has multiple examples for different malwares and some contains helpful demonstrations. One of them is the *keylogger*.

I already knew what a keylogger is from completing *CS2413 - Information Security* at UNB, but I could never truly understood the concept of it since I coudn't visualize how it would work. The demonstration that *Codecademy* has is very helpful and I find it pretty cool. So, I wanted to create my own. And, ta-da, I finally made it!

### Technologies/Languages that I used to Build This Project
- Visual Studio Code
  - [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer "Live Server - Visual Studio Marketplace")
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
  - jQuery

### What I Learned/Got from This Project
- Practiced HTML, CSS, and JS. 
  - My current co-op work term (2nd work term) required me to do a lot of HTML, CSS, and JS, so this project helped me to practice and improve my fluency in these languages.
- Created a webpage that the user can interact with
- Reviewed cybersecurity concepts
  - There are a lot of different types of malware, so it is nice to review and have more of an understanding of malware by doing these kinds of projects.

### What I Felt that Could Have Been Better
I feel like the design isn't that pretty and captivating yet. It's fairly simple. To be able to make beautiful webpages, I think I need more experience with web development and also learn about UI/UX Design.

### My Opinion on This Project
I'm pretty proud of this one. At the moment, I'm not really sure what I want to do after graduation: Software Development or Cybersecurity. I think both are really interesting since I love fixing bugs and coding but I also want to learn more about cyber threats and how to fight them. So, to make a project that both combines some coding and cybersecurity is really cool to me.
