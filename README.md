## Title of Project
Keylogger

## Description
**Keylogger** is used to demostrate the idea of how a keylogger would work. The webpage contains general information about what a keylogger is and how to protect yourself against them. The main part of this webpage is the demonstration part, which will help the user to understand more about the keylogger. 

**DISCLAIMER**: The demonstration is not a real keylogger. I'm not smart nor talented enough to create one. Feel free to use it.

## Inspiration for this Project
This project is inspired by *Codecademy*'s [Introduction to Cybersecurity](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-cybersecurity "Codeacademy - Introduction to Cybersecurity Course") course. The *Cyber Threats* section has multiple examples for different malwares and some contains helpful demonstrations. One of them is the *keylogger*.

I already knew what a keylogger is from completing *CS2413 - Information Security* at UNB, but I could never truly understood the concept of it since I coudn't visualize how it would work. The demonstration that *Codecademy* has helps me understand how a keylogger works and I find it pretty cool. So, I wanted to create my own. And, ta-da, I finally made it!
